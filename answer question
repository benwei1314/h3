What code draws the blades of grass?
function draw() {
  stroke(random(150, 70), 100, 90);
  line(x, height-10, x+random(-50, 10), height-10-random(h));
  noStroke();
What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
if (random(100) > 99.9) {        //create a random grass between 100 to 99 start at low number to high number. 100>300 lesser chance to cut. 100>20 more chance to cut
    fill(255);
    rect(0, 0, width, height-15);
    h = 10;                
What's the point of the h variable?
//h if grass is 10 it cuts all the grass
What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h) ? Why is it there?
//it angles the grass so it's verticle
